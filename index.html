							<h3>About Me</h3>
							<p>Name: Ervine </p>
							<p>Student Number: s3789276  </p>
							<p>Email Address: s3789276@student.rmit.edu.au  </p>
							<p>Nationality: Chinese (Australian born)  </p>
							<p>Languages Spoken: Just English  </p>
							<p>Hobbys: Reading, Gaming, Youtube, Anime, Movies  </p>
							<p>My interest in IT has been in the back of my mind for a long time. I have been gaming on computers and other consoles for a long time and it never occurred to me that I could get a job working on them. I did not take any computer related studies in high school (which I very much regret) and only started in Tafe after I finished my science bachelors. I looked into Tafe because one of my long-time friends did a games programming course in ultimo and told me it was great. Where I live it is very hard to commute into the city, so I ended up choosing to go to the local Tafe and doing a course on networking which I found really interesting and new since I had never done anything like it before. Learning about virtualisation in that course was really eye opening for me as I had never thought about it before. After this diploma I managed to score a job as help desk for a Point of sale company. In this job I have only used very basic knowledge of networking and have gained more knowledge of windows and had a window into programming, but I feel I have reached the limit of what I can learn from this Job. </p>
						<p>Which is why I chose to continue my IT studies at RMIT. I won&#146t lie one of the main reasons for this is simply because it is an online course and I don&#146t have to commute as I did in the past for my Bachelors of Science. My other reasons include the reputation of RMIT some of my cousins have been studied there and have told me that it was a great place for learning though they were on campus students. </p>
						<p>In this degree I expect to learn a whole lot more about what I can do in IT. Just as I learned about virtualisation for the first time in my Tafe diploma I expect to learn about new technologies in RMIT. I also want to learn more about networking and dive into the programming side of IT that I have really only dipped my toes into. Learning about all the different languages really has me excited. </p>

							<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
							<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38479964?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=b3d4487f-60e4-4c3d-b8a5-f31202e9d3ec">Seek Job Advertisement</a> </p>
							<p>In this position I will be working on development of the game with a team of other experienced game developers. I will mostly be optimising the system and ensuring that the servers don&#146t go down, so the players don&#146t suffer any downtime. As a Gamer I have always wanted to know how to make them and this job will put me in a position to help create a new game and include blockchain technology in the game. It even has plans to become an esport which is very exciting. </p>
							<p>To get this job I will need experience in the C# programming language, using the Unity engine and using AWS(Amazon Web Services). They also need Backend Development experience in Golang and experience in distributed systems. Be able to build automation for the optimisation of the game and version control tools. </p>
							<p>My experience in programming or in any of these skills is none so I have a long way to go. So I hope to gain these some of these skills in my RMIT Bachelor mainly the C# and automation experience. For the other skills required I will need to take on additional courses or program in my own time to gain the experience. The best thing would be to learn through another job. </p>

							<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
							<p>Myers Briggs Result: Logician</p>
							<p>Learning Test Result: Visual</p>
							<p>Big 5 Personalities Test Result: Openness 54%, Conscientiousness 40%, Extraversion 15%, Agreeableness 79%, Neuroticism 52% </p>
							<p>To me these results confirm that that I am a very introverted person as I always knew. Though it is interesting to learn that I am a visual learner as I never really knew how I should study. </p>
							<p>Due to my personality I usually let others take the lead in teams and do what I need to do in order to not let the team down. I am a as long as I do my bit it will all work out kind of guy. </p>
							<p>In my team I would hope for a capable leader to direct the others. And getting to know everyone would be extremely important to get over my introvertedness and be able to speak my own mind to the team. </p>

					<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
					<p>My Project idea is a fantasy action mmorpg where all the npcs are individual AI and the world will change dependent on the players. What I mean by this is that players will drop into a fully functioning world run by the npcs. They will be given quests by npcs like in normal mmorpgs but none of it will be scripted by developers. The npcs will generate quests themselves based on their own wants and needs. These quests can go from simple delivery quests to all out wars between kingdoms and empires where the power of the players will determine the outcome. </p>
					<p>The motivation for this came from the theory that our world is a simulation run by someone else so I would like to create a new fantasy world simulation but also have it be a playground for us. I think it would be very interesting to see how the world turns out with and without human interference. </p>
					<p>The features of the game would be like any standard mmo game with quests and combat and crafting. Players will be able to choose from a variety of combat and non-combat classes. Combat classes are those that specialise in fighting against monster and man. While non-combat classes will specialise in crafting items, farming or trading (becoming a merchant). The non-combat classes will also be able to fight just not as well as the combat classes and the combat classes will be able to engage in trade or farming or crafting but they will not be as good as the noncombat classes. Players will be able to interact with the AI npcs through voice chat and by doing so can build relationships with the npcs and get special quests from them. By completing quests players will be able to earn rewards and reputation with higher reputation giving the player the ability to be recognised by common npcs and even form relationships with important npcs such as lords of cities or kings or other such nobility and thus gain quests from them. Players interactions with npcs can affect the world, for instance by gaining the support of the npc nobility the player may be able to usurp the throne and become king themselves or if a player or group of players is strong enough, they may destroy the npc kingdoms and build their own on top of it. Players will also be able to settle unexplored regions of the map and build up their own villages, towns and cities eventually forming their own kingdoms and empires. Unlike other games of the genre where the player is the chosen hero and all the story and events are scripted by programmers this world will be a living breathing world that changes based on the players interaction. Another feature of the game will be that each continent will start with the same copy of the world state. From there the players will interact with the world changing the world in their continent so the game can be very different for each continent. </p>
					<p>For the hardware there will be servers all around the world in every continent.  Servers will have to be robust in order to get maximum uptime. For the game itself it will run Unreal engine 4 for the graphics and coding. New AI will have to be developed to make the npcs as realistic as possible so that they can have personalities to be able to build relations with players and other npcs. Through utilising their needs and wants they generate appropriate quests to give to players. It will be like google home or amazon&#146s alexa except the AI will be asking you to do things for them. </p>
					<p>For me it will be very hard to develop this project as I have none of the skills required from using the Unreal engine to coding the AI and setting up the servers for it all to run on. Unreal engine itself requires experience in C++ and python is said to be good for programming AI due to its simplicity. People that have these skills won&#146t be too hard to find and the servers required for such an mmo already exist. In order to get the people and the hardware though will be very expensive. </p>
					<p>If the project is successful, we will have created an mmo like no other where the story will entirely be up to the AI npcs and the quests they hand out to the players. The outcomes of those quests could change the state of the world. By doing this Players will create their own stories from their own actions. It will be interesting to see how each of the copies in the different continents will end up and it will also be interesting to see what would happen in a world with no player interaction. </p>
